🚀 About Me

I’m a computer science student who is actively rebuilding my foundations and skills after realizing the importance of deep learning and consistent practice.
I enjoy understanding how systems work behind the scenes, which is why I’m especially interested in backend development and software architecture.

Currently, I’m focusing on becoming a strong full-stack developer with a solid grasp of both frontend and backend technologies.
